## Issues We Planned to Address

We planned to begin addressing the overall app, establishing the file structure and basic user interface for the type of data we will be working with. We planned to do this as minimally as possible, using a mock backend for the frontend, and a mock frontend for the backend.

## Issues Successfully Completed

We successfully completed a minimal initial version of the frontend and backend, with a basic user interface and a mock backend. We also successfully completed the user stories for creating, reading, editing, and deleting a recipe. We have a rough plan for implementing the remaining necessary features, and we have a basic understanding of how to implement them.

## Issues Not Successfully Completed & Why?

Technical issues caused by initial interactions with GitHub led to loss of code, progress, and morale.
